Content Standardizer is a Google Workspace add-on that standardizes formatting and structure across Google Docs documents.

- **Data Access**: The add-on reads document content (text, headings, formatting) from Google Docs to analyze and standardize formatting. No content is stored permanently.
- **Data Storage**: Standardization logs and undo history are stored in Script Properties. No document content is stored permanently.
- **Data Sharing**: No data is sent to or shared with third parties. All processing happens within Google's infrastructure.
- **File Operations**: The add-on modifies document formatting within Google Docs. This changes how the document appears but does not alter the underlying content.
- **Logging**: Operational logs are written to Apps Script Logger for troubleshooting. Standardization actions are logged for undo.
- **Removal**: Remove stored logs and settings by uninstalling the add-on or clearing Script Properties.
- **Support**: For privacy questions, open an issue in the repository or contact support@tangentforge.com.
