# Terms of Service

By installing or using Content Standardizer you agree to:

1. **Scope**: The add-on is provided to assist users with standardizing formatting and structure across Google Docs documents.
2. **Acceptable Use**: Do not use the add-on to access documents you don't have permission to view or to violate Google's terms for Workspace add-ons.
3. **Data Handling**: Document content and standardization logs are stored in Script Properties. No content is stored permanently.
4. **File Operations**: The add-on modifies document formatting. This changes how the document appears but does not alter the underlying content.
5. **Backup Recommendation**: We recommend using Google Docs version history to revert changes if needed.
6. **Undo Limitations**: Undo functionality is limited to the last standardization action. Use Google Docs version history for full revision control.
7. **Availability**: The add-on is provided "as is" without uptime guarantees. Performance depends on Docs API limits.
8. **Warranty & Liability**: Provided without warranty. Use at your own risk; authors are not liable for damages arising from use or document modifications.
9. **Support**: Community support is available via the repository issues page.
10. **Changes**: Terms and functionality may change; continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.
